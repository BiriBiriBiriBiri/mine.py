PURPOSE:
Get that SLIME as fast and easily as possible

HOW TO RUN THE EASY WAY:

2. Download the latest version of mine.zip
3. Extract zip file.
4. Run mine.exe.

HOW TO RUN THE HARD WAY:
1. Install python3 from here https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open a command prompt
3. Type in "pip install discord.py" and wait for it to install
4. Download or clone the git repository (this page, the green button).
5. Run the file mine.py with python3.

HOW TO USE:
On your first run of the program, it should prompt you for your username and password. This is your discord username and password. Input them after the prompts. You only need to do this once. Then, after a few seconds it will say "Logged in as <your username>". Once that appears, just go into a channel and type "!mine" once. Your account will begin spamming !mine immediatly. To stop this, simply close the window. 
  
If you wish to delete the saved account username and password, simply delete all the files that start with "sauth.db" 

If you have any problems contact @BiriBiri on RFCK Discord or the Rowdy Fuckers Discord.
